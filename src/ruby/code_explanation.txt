This directory contains Ruby extensions sourced from FreeBSD documentation,
which can be found at https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-doc/tree/main/shared/lib
or https://cgit.freebsd.org/doc/plain/shared/lib/. These extensions are compiled
to JavaScript using the Opal compiler and are placed in the "lib" folder.

It is essential to periodically check for updates to these extensions and
ensure that the JavaScript versions are kept up-to-date accordingly.
